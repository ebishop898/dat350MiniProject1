    "This survey was distributed online using Google Forms and shared with participants through the class Discord, with fellow college students, and with friends and family. Participants completed the survey voluntarily and anonymously. Respondents were given approximately five days to complete the survey. The survey consisted primarily of multiple-choice and checkbox questions related to lighting preferences and habits in their rooms.\n",

    "This study relied on self-reported data, which may introduce response bias. Additionally, the sample size was relatively small and consisted mainly of college students, limiting generalizability. Some questions allowed open-ended responses or had inconsistent wording, which required manual cleaning and grouping for analysis.\n",
